This is a cvs import of my (very old) run-free project on sourceforge.net

https://sourceforge.net/projects/run-free/

Full conversion to github is pending. 
For now see the sourceforge project page (above) for project information

## Description: 
run-free is a GUI command line launcher application for your Xwindows desktop. It is designed to be key-driven and flexible. The purpose for run-free is to be able to flexibly run command line programs and such from your X desktop.

## Project Notes:
This directory structure has changed to accomidate for new versions of
run-free now and in the future. The directories are named by the
runfree toplevel version number (i.e. if you are trying to get to
run-free 2.x.x.x then grab 'version2'...).

As of 3-17-04 the source code under version1 will no longer be
supported. Please feel free to visit the project home page at
http://run-free.sourceforge.net and the author's home page at
http://www.sleepingstill.com for more information on this project and
others by this same author.
