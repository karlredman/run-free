Welcome to the Sourceforge.net run-free repository.

This directory structure has changed to accomidate for new versions of
run-free now and in the future. The directories are named by the
runfree toplevel version number (i.e. if you are trying to get to
run-free 2.x.x.x then grab 'version2'...).

As of 3-17-04 the source code under version1 will no longer be
supported. Please feel free to visit the project home page at
http://run-free.sourceforge.net and the author's home page at
http://www.sleepingstill.com for more information on this project and
others by this same author.

Sincerely, 
Karl N. Redman
