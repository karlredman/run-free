The files in this directory are not part of the regular
distribution. Rather they are here, most generally, for packaging and
preperation of the distribution. 

The mainpage.* files are refered to by the main.c file for doxygen in
order that we have a somewhat standardized way of creating our main
doxygen source documentation page. 

Doxyfile is the Doxygen configuration file I used to create the source
code documentation from.

my_bldpkg is a quicky script for autotools stuff.

run-free.spec is my RPM spec file (outdated currently)
